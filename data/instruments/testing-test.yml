  <p>The Clone 101 Reality Player is a thin layer of liquid coating that the person puts on. Like a full head to toe body suit, the instrument not only allows to hear and feel vibrations of the music, but also allows the person to experience the simulated creation of the music from the mind, sight and psychological feelings of the producer. </p>

  <p>The person would be able to see where and how the music was created through the visual lenses of the suit. Understanding how anything is created has enormous benefits to any art form. The thought process and mind-set of the creator leading up until and after the music was made could be a valuable tool in which to understand the true purpose and direction of the artwork.</p>

  <p>A coating of the entire body, applied like and as thin as layer of sun tan lotion, the Clone 101 consist of thousands of invisible microscopic sensors that feeds the person physical information like body temperature, heart rate and all sensations of the body of the creator at the time the artwork was created.</p>
